📘 Python Assignment – Task 1 & Task 2

This project contains two simple Python programs written in PyCharm.
They demonstrate basic input handling, conditional statements, and loops.


---

✅ Task 1 – Even or Odd Number Checker

This program asks the user to enter a number and then checks whether the number is even or odd.

🔍 How it works

The program takes an integer input from the user

It checks:

If the number is divisible by 2 → prints “The number is even.”

Otherwise → prints “The number is odd.”



📌 Purpose

To practice:

Taking user input

Using if-else conditional statements

Performing modulus operation %

✅ Task 2 – Sum of Numbers from 1 to 50

This program calculates the total sum of all integers from 1 to 50.

🔍 How it works

A variable is used to store the sum

A loop runs from 1 to 50

Each number is added to the total

Finally, the program prints the result

Sum = 1275


📌 Purpose

To practice:

Using loops (for loop)

Accumulating values

Printing results
